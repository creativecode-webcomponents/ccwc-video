CCWC-Video
==========

CCWCVideo plays back video or web camera feeds. Playback is offered on an internal canvas as well. Consumers can draw directly into this canvas, get a copy
of the framedata or even take the canvas context for use on another canvas


Element attributes
------------------

&lt;ccwc-video

- **useCamera** *(boolean)* If present, the component will use your webcam. You must give it an index or ID source via the src attribute or through the API

- **src** *(string or integer)* If present, this will set the source video of your component. If **useCamera** is present, this source can either be an integer or ID to represent your webcam

- **useCanvasForDisplay** *(boolean)* If present, this component will hide the video, and instead show the internal canvas that draws the frames from the vidoe

- **frameDataMode** *(string: "binary", "imagedataurl" (default), or "imagedata"* Setting for the data in the event that occurs when the frame is redrawn.

  - **binary** binary image output

  - **imagedataurl** good for setting the source of an img tag or similar

  - **imagedata** good for applying to another canvas element

- **canvasRefreshInterval** (integer) How often, in milliseconds, the internal canvas is refreshed. Default is 250ms which is a bit choppy To see results, be sure to use with "useCanvasForDisplay". Alternately, use this to drive regular update events

- **canvasScale** (float/number) Scaling of the canvas and scale of image data from the frame update events. 0.5, for example will show content at half size
&gt;

&lt;/ccwc-video&gt;
